      <h2> The Problem </h2>
      <p>
        Storing energy from intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, is one of the most pressing challenges we face for enabling a sustainable civilization. 
        The scale of the problem is immense. 
        A wide array of energy storage technologies are under development, each with their own advantages and disadvantages for various use cases. 
        Scientific research into energy storage technologies has exploded in recent years and sorting through this large body of knowledge to understand the state of field is an important and challenging problem.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2> The Goal </h2> 
      <p>
        This project uses artificial intelligence to extract insights from the scientific literature with the goal of being able to better direct research efforts and investments towards promising technologies.
        Below are links to different visualizations of the data using a variety of natural language processing techniques and accompanying visuals.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2> The Data </h2>
      <p>
        Each of the machine learning algorithms used below were trained on a collection of article abstracts pulled from Microsoft Academic related to energy storage.
        The abstracts were obtained with the search term "Energy Storage", keeping the top 100,000 results.
        Duplicate papers were removed (identified by DOI) and opnly articles in english were retained, resulting in approximately 40,000 abstracts.<br><br>

          Topic modeling is a machine learning problem where you have a collection (corpus) of documents, and you want to extract topics from the unstructured text data.
          In our case, our corpus is the set of abstracts pulled from Microsoft Academic, and we want to extract topics of interesting research from these texts.
          Once we've extracted these topics, we create a graph of topics where each node is a topic and each edge represents the probability of these topics co-occuring in an abstract.
          Different features of the graph convey further information about how prevelant a topic is or how frequently it has shown up in abstracts in the past five years.<br><br>

          <span class="fieldname"> Goal: </span> 
          
          The goal of this modeling and visualization is to algorithmically produce a high-level overview of the field and 
          to allow users to interactively explore different topics and the connections between them.
          We hope this provides insight into surprising connections between different areas of the field or trending topics of interest.
          This visualization can also be used to explore literature in the field related to each topic or their connections.<br><br>
          
          <span class="fieldname"> Algorithms: </span> 
          
          This visualization relies primarily on two techniques: Latend Dirichlet Allocation and Louvain Community Detection.<br><br>
     
          <b> Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) </b> is a popular algorithm used for topic modeling.
          It models topics as probability distributions over words.  
          (<e> ex: the topic of "pets" contains the word "cat" with a high probability and "solar_panel" with a low probability. </e>)
          Topics can be represented by the words that have the highest probability of belonging to the topic.
          Furthermore, each document has a certain probability of containing each topic.  
          (<e> ex: An article about healthy pet diets has a high probability of containing the topics "food", "pets", and "health" and a low probability of containing the topic "foreign_politics."</e>)
          We performed topic modeling with 100 topics and then produced a graph where nodes represent topics and edges represent the probability of topics occuring in the same document.
          (<e> ex: the topics "health" and "food" are more likely to co-occur than "pets" and "foreign_politics".</e>) <br><br>
          
          <b> Louvain Community Detection </b>
          The Louvain Community Detection algorithm is used on large intereconnected graphs to separate nodes into related groups or communities.
          It starts out by defining each node as an individual community.
          It then uses a similarity metric to compare adjacent nodes, and if they are similar enough, it merges the two communities.
          When it has gone through every node, it creates a new graph in which each community is a single node.
          It repeats this process until no nodes are similar enough to merge.
          The end result is a grouping of similar nodes into research communities.
          These are represented by the colors of the nodes in our graph.<br> <br>

          <span class="fieldname"> Description: </span> 
          Word2Vec is an ML algorithm for embedding words as vectors.  
          The words in the corpus are contextually embedded into an array of numbers that can be conceptualized as a point in high dimensional space.
          We can easily compare how close these vectors are in high dimensional space, giving us a good idea of how similar the words are.
          Since we can't easily visualize high dimensional space, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select the two most informative dimensions and plot those
          for more accessible human visualization and comprehension. <br> <br>
